# CV assitant
> Project for the course ICD0007 Web technologies

## Description of the project
This program will be a kind of CV assistant. A unified platform in which a person can add any information about himself that he believes will help him when applying for a job. And during the application process, a person does not need to create a new CV and send it to the HR manager. He or she can simply send their own link, which will contain a large amount of information about the person. That is, the platform automatically searches or requests the necessary information and, if possible, fills it in itself. There will be such moments as feedback from the employer, colleagues, (you can also add people who taught you). It will also be possible to add all the courses that the person took and the projects in which they participated. Social networks also have a role to play there, because the employer can see what his potential employee is doing in his free time.
